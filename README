Picsnvideos is a plugin for JPilot. It fetches pictures and
videos from late model Palm smartphones.

Take a look at https://github.com/CoSoCo/JPilotMediaPlugin for a fork
of this project that offers a lot more functionality.

Picsnvideos supports the Treo 650, Treo 680, Treo 700p, Treo 755p, and
the Centro.  Only the Treo 650 and Centro have been known to be tested.

This plugin fetches, rather than syncs.  The plugin reads pictures and
videos taken with the camera on the Palm, and stores them on the computer.
It will also fetch audio captions added with the 'Pics&Videos'
application (known as 'Media' on older Palms). Files are never deleted
from the Palm or from the computer.

Files from the internal memory of the Palm are stored in
'$HOME/PalmPictures/Device'.  Files from the Palm's SD Card are stored in
'$HOME/PalmPictures/SDCard'.

Each album on the Palm is a directory under 'Device/' or 'SDCard/'.
Some older Palms will create an 'Unfiled/' directory for pictures and
videos that have not yet been moved to an album.

The file extensions of the files that picsnvideos fetches include:
    .jpg - JPEG pictures
    .amr - audio photo captions from GSM phones
    .qcp - audio photo captions from CDMA phones
    .3gp - video clips from GSM phones
    .3g2 - video clips from CDMA phones

The audio photo captions are named <photo_name.jpg>.amr or
<photo_name.jpg>.qcp.  For example, the picture
photo_051608_001.jpg  will have an audio caption named
photo_051608_001.jpg.amr (or .qcp).

Once a picture or video has been fetched, it will never be fetched
again even if it moved to a different album.  Re-recorded audio captions
will be refetched.  To force all pictures to be re-fetched, delete
the file $HOME/.jpilot/picsnvideos-fetched.gdbm.

Problems or suggestions can be reported in the forums or tracker at
https://github.com/danbodoh/picsnvideos-jpilot.  it is helpful to include
the output that 'jpilot -d' creates whey you sync.
This output goes both to standard output and to 'jpilot.log'.
